# Welcome to my portfolio project!
So at first I made my design skiss in Figma to be able to even start, put some ideas on the board to get going.  

While I was looking for inspiration I stumbled across animations, especially on 3D flipping cards. It looked so cool I couldn't sleep if I didn't try to make it myself. That was the first styling I did to my HTML. I had troubles with my GitHub, having VS Code using two different accounts and confusion so I set my new GitHub name to *Chokladglasyr*, which is usually my gamertag, so for my flipping cards I used that name on the back, thought why not, then there will be some connection to my GitHub (if anyone decides to actually click the link to my GitHub).

I then continued on the rest of the styling and tried to check all the mandatory elements for the assignment.  

When that was done I started to have abit of fun, implemented some more animations etc.  

I wanted a fixed/ sticky "up button", at first it was just two arrows but it was so boring... So I came up with an idea that its going to be a little dude but when you click on him he has a balloon and floats up. It didn't really work with display: hidden; so I checked in with Olli Heikki and he showed me content: url() so that was nice!  

I wanted a logo, but being not so creative on the design bit I was scared of not being able to come up with one. But then I remembered. My name! So my full name is **I**da **D**ella **A**i-ling **L**im **P**ek, IDALP, I tried with two dashes. --IDALP and it looked nice, like a little code snippet of some sorts. I wanted it in the same font as written in code so I just printscreened, but while doing it I saw the line blinking after I wrote... yes! A new animation coming up!

I disliked my button on the frontpage to scroll down, but didn't know how to fix it until I came across a scroll animation video (which wasnt actually a scroll animation but an animation to indicate to scroll lol). And that kinda fixed my problem with my balloon dude. If I put him in the body he added a whole whitespace, if I put him in the main he wouldn't be in the footer... and I got some help from Olli Heikki with hiding the balloon dude so he didnt show in the first two sections. z index to the rescue! But yeah, so I implemented the arrow animation at the bottom too and I don't know, I feel it kind of ties the whole website together with it starting with the arrows and then ending with same arrows.

Oh well, maybe not that proffesional but I had fun making it and it's **good enough**!!
